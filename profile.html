            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
                My current goal is to land a Jr.Software Developer job at the company that
                I currently work at. I have been working there for 4 years and have had a 
                positive experience. They have invested in me and has provided opportunities
                to move upwards into a technology career. I really identify with the company
                goal to bring renewable energy to communities.

                In the future, I hope to use the knowledge and experience gained to help
                progress renewable energy technology so that everyone can have a healthy 
                and safe life.
